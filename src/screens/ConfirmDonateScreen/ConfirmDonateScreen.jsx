                🌟 Thank you for your generosity! 🙏🍽️

                Your decision to donate food is truly inspiring. A representative from our NGO will be coming to collect the food during the time slot you selected. Your contribution will help feed the hungry and make a meaningful impact.

                We sincerely appreciate your compassion and support. Together, we can make a difference and bring smiles to those in need. Thank you for being a caring soul!
